[Vizydrop](https://vizydrop.com/) is a data visualization platform developed by the same blokes that brought you [Targetprocess](http://www.targetprocess.com/).  Create and share charts from CSV, Excel, and JSON files or connect and visualize data from various apps that you are using; all with no effort, in a single place, in a natural way, for free.

While developing [Targetprocess](http://www.targetprocess.com/), we tried a lot of existing visualization services and failed to find a good, simple tool. So, we decided to make our own. Thatâ€™s why you can be sure that every feature we create has come from the most demanding user: us.

Vizydrop was designed to be not only easy to use, but easy to integrate with. Keeping the developer in mind, we have designed Vizydrop to make it as easy as possible for users to integrate their own applications.

Integrating your application with Vizydrop is achieved by implementing a RESTful API interface according to our specs. To make it even easier, we've developed an easy-to-use {{site.data.vizydrop.vizydrop_urls.python_sdk.link}} that ensures your integration won't take months to develop. Couple that with examples in a few of the more popular programming languages and open-source integrations for our built-in apps.
